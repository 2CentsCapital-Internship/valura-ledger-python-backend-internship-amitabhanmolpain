"""Your ledger. This is the whole assignment.

`client.py` handles the network and hands you one event at a time. You return
the journal legs it produced. Some events correctly produce none: return an
empty list, not None-as-an-accident.

One event type is implemented as a worked example. The rest raise, with the rule
from PROTOCOL.md quoted in the message, so a practice run tells you exactly what
is left rather than silently scoring zero.

Two things to get right before anything else:

  * Use `Decimal`, never `float`. Money here does not always divide evenly, and
    a float implementation will disagree with us by a cent in places you will
    struggle to find.
  * Key balances by (customer, account), not by account. At least one event
    moves money between two customers on the same account, and an
    account-level book shows nothing wrong at all.
